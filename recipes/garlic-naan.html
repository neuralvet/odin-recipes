    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is a fairly simple way to make garlic naan. I sometimes cook it
    outside on my Blackstone. Other times, I will cook it in a cast iron skillet.
    Keep in mind that if you cook indoors, it may get a bit smokey. 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2tsp Active Dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 TBSP sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm tap water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (lukewarm)</li>
        <li>1tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 TBSP olive oil</li>
        <li>360 grams All Purpose floud (about 3 cups)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix yeast, water, and sugard together in a bowl. Let the yeast bloom</li>
        <li>Add milk, salt, garlic paste, and oil to another bowl. I whiz this up
            in the microwave for a few seconds to warm the milk up as it should be &ldquo;lukewarm&rdquo;.
        </li>
        <li>Add contents of both bowls toger and hand mix. If it is too wet,
            add some flour. Knead 1-2 minutes in the bowl. The dough will be a bit
            wet; it should not be very dry.
        </li>
        <li>Cover and let rise about 1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down and transfer to flour dusted surface.</li>
        <li>Cut into 8 pieces. Roll out and cook on on stovetop.</li>
        <li>Brush with garlic, butter, olive oil mixure while cooking.</li> 
    </ol>
